    Unfortunately, docker-compose is not yet officially released
     for Windows There's still some rough edges, and volume
     configuration is one. There's also some open issues in
     boot2docker for windows which makes things difficult.

    We have to change the volume specifications to a very specific
     format:

     - absolute paths: relative one's are not yet supported
     - currently only works if the project is running on the C:\ drive
     - unix style paths: need to replace '\' with '/'
     - paths have to start with /c/ instead of C:\ otherwise
        docker-compose gets confused because they use : as separation

    Example:
      unix format:  .:/app:rw
      cwd:          C:\Users\aldryn\acme-portfolio
      windows:     /c/Users/aldryn/acme-portfolio:/app:rw

    Hope that's all. And of course, I'm sorry.
